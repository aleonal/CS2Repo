# CS2Repo

This repository is a collection of activities that
my colleague and I conducted during Spring 2018 as
Peer Leaders of The University of Texas at El Paso's
Elementary Data Structures class.

I write and conduct my activities in a way that 
promotes a dynamic approach and problem solving
over simply programming. I believe that
computer science is about solving problems first,
then using computers to automate the work for us.

**2D Arrays**

The purpose of this activity is to refresh student's
minds with an activity on arrays. We also introduce 
the concept of jagged arrays.

**Linked Lists**

We expanded on the concept of linked lists and explained some
elementary operations:

 - Printing elements in a list (+ recursively)
 - Adding elements to the end of a list (+ recursively)
 - Removing the last element in a list (+ recursively)
 - Adding elements to the beginning of a list (+ recursively)
 - Searching for nth element in a list (only iteratively)
 - Removing nth element in a list (only recursively)
 - Calculating length of list (only recursively)
 
We provided a simple node class for all of
these activities given the time constraint for them.

**Stacks**

Similarly to linked lists, we expanded on the concept of
abstract data structures and explained some elementary
operations of a linked list implementation of a stack:
 
 - Push into a stack
 - Peek into a stack
 - Pop from a stack
 - Determine whether a stack is empty

We used the previous linked list class to create our stack
class. Additionally, we conducted an activity in which
students had to determine if a given string was a palindrome
by only using a stack.

**Queues**

Another abstract data structure, we expanded the concept of
queues and explained some elementary operations using a
linked list implementation of queues. Additionally,
we covered a stack-based implementation of queues in order
to emphasize the relationship between FIFO and LIFO:

 - Enqueue into a queue (+ stack implementation)
 - Dequeue from a queue (+ stack implementation)
 - Print a queue (+ stack implementation)
 
**Trees**

Although students learned about simple trees, binary and
binary search trees, as well as AVL trees, we only covered
binary and binary search trees in our activities:

 - Insert into binary & binary search tree
 - Print pre-order, in-order, post-order
 
We provided a simple binary tree node class for all these
activities given the time constraint for them.
